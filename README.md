📌 Project Description

This repository contains a fully functional, menu-driven calculator application developed using the Python programming language. The program operates through the terminal and offers a simple yet effective interface for performing essential mathematical operations. Users can carry out four primary arithmetic functions:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division, including a dedicated safeguard to prevent division-by-zero errors

The project was created using Visual Studio Code as the primary development environment, ensuring a clean and organized workflow. All changes were carefully tracked using Git, and the final project is hosted on GitHub to demonstrate proper version control practices, professional documentation, and repository management. This project aims not only to showcase basic Python programming skills but also to reflect an understanding of real-world development techniques used in modern software engineering.

🔧 Key Features

Clear and user-friendly menu interface that allows smooth navigation

Support for both integer and floating-point values, enabling versatile calculations

Comprehensive input validation to handle incorrect or unexpected user input gracefully

Continuous execution using loops, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit

Readable, structured, and well-commented code, making the logic easy to understand and maintain
